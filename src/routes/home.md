# CMinusMinus

A Compiler made with **flex** and **bison** that translates a subset of **C code** into assembly language for the **Intel 8086 processor**.

This was done as series of four assignments for the course [***CSE310 - Compiler Sessional***](https://github.com/Abir66/CSE-310-Compiler-Sessional/tree/main) at BUET.

**Emscripten** was used to convert the project to **WebAssembly** and **JavaScript** so that it can be run in the browser.
